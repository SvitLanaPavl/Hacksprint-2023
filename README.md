# 2023 Holberton Hacksprint :microphone:
On December 20th 2023 C21 will have their first Hacksprint! A Hacksprint is the final project that students were given to wrap up the second trimester of school. Teams consist of two members and each team has one week to get their project done. December's Hacksprint is based off of a specific theme, **Winter**! All students must make anything that they want, from a game, to a website. Our team decided to go with a website since we are both aspiring fullstack web developers. Through this project, we aim to solidify our understanding, refine our problem-solving abilities, and create a tangible showcase of our capabilities.

# Our Project, "Winter In Tulsa" :christmas_tree:
We have created a one page, interactive website. Our website focuses on tourism in Tulsa, Oklahoma specifically in the winter. We highlight five different activities that we found fun and interesting to do, from dining, to ice-skating! Our website sorts out fun events/activities to do in the winter, while giving the user information about each event, including hours open, ticketing prices, location, and a short description of what they are looking at. Each event has a clickable button that sends the user to the official website of the chosen event so they could get more information.

# How to test our website ðŸ§ª
Find the latest release of our website through github, its hosted by github and no download is required!

As you can see in the image above, the user is greeted with an absolutely mesmerizing landing page. The user can click on the arrows to go left or right and see what other events are displayed on the carousel. The user has the option to click on the "learn more" button if they are interested in that specific event. Once the button is clicked they get sent to a section about that event where they see the following details; hours open, ticketing prices, location, and a short description of what they are looking at. Heres an example below:
